# About
My revised code for https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/.

# Setup

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

create a `.env` file and include your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx
```

Then, run the notebooks using VSCode. 

# Changes

Only minor changes were made to the original code:

- added `requirements.txt` for easy setup
- corrected some typos
- changed the translation to Chinese
